                <h4>Front end web developer</h4>
                <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                    directly.
                    The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                    the
                    front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how
                    the
                    field is developing.</p>
